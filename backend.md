# Sparky Backend Architecture: A Supabase Implementation

## 1. Introduction & Core Principles

This document provides a comprehensive blueprint for the backend architecture of the Sparky application. As you may recall, the client-side application is currently using mock data. This document outlines the transition to a full-stack, production-ready system.

**Core Principle:** The entire backend will be built and hosted on **Supabase**, a powerful open-source Firebase alternative. This provides us with a cohesive, scalable, and manageable platform that includes Authentication, a Postgres Database, Storage, Edge Functions, and Real-time capabilities out of the box.

This architecture is designed to be:
- **Scalable:** Leveraging Supabase's managed cloud infrastructure.
- **Secure:** Utilizing Row Level Security (RLS) and environment secrets.
- **Performant:** Offloading heavy AI processing to serverless Edge Functions and using an in-database cache.
- **Maintainable:** A single, integrated platform simplifies development and operations.

## 2. Supabase Services Overview

We will leverage the following integrated Supabase services:

- **Supabase Auth:** For user registration, login, and session management.
- **Supabase Database (Postgres):** Our primary relational database for storing all application data, including a caching layer.
- **Supabase Storage:** For securely storing user-uploaded images and AI-generated results.
- **Supabase Edge Functions:** For running server-side business logic, especially calls to the Gemini API and payment webhooks.
- **Supabase Realtime:** For pushing live updates to the client.

## 3. Authentication (Supabase Auth)

User management is the foundation of our application's security and data privacy.

### Implementation:

- **Providers:** We will start with secure email/password authentication. Supabase Auth handles email confirmation, password resets, and secure session management (JWTs) automatically.
- **User Identity:** When a user signs up, Supabase Auth creates a new entry in the private `auth.users` table. This provides a unique `id` (UUID) for each user, which will be the cornerstone of our data security model.
- **Client-Side Integration:** The frontend will use the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library to handle `signUp()`, `signInWithPassword()`, and `signOut()` operations. The library will automatically manage JWT storage and refresh tokens.

### Security:

- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Every table containing user-specific data will have RLS policies enabled. These policies ensure that a logged-in user can only access and modify their own data. The user's ID, extracted from their JWT (`auth.uid()`), will be used in these policies.

---

## 4. Database Schema (Supabase Postgres)

The database is the heart of our application, persisting all user data, generations, and settings. The schema is derived directly from the types defined in `types.ts` and replaces all mock data.

### 4.1 Data Types (ENUMs)
We define custom types for consistency across tables.
```sql
CREATE TYPE public.tool_type AS ENUM ('TRANSFORMATION', 'FILTER', 'ANALYSIS');
CREATE TYPE public.gender AS ENUM ('male', 'female');
```

### 4.2 Core User & Activity Tables

#### `plans`
Stores available subscription plans. This data is public.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.plans (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  monthly_credits INT NOT NULL,
  max_daily_credits INT NOT NULL
);
-- RLS Policy: Plans are public and readable by everyone.
ALTER TABLE public.plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Plans are publicly viewable" ON public.plans FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

#### `users`
Stores public-facing user profile information, linked to the `auth.users` table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  plan_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.plans(id) DEFAULT 1,
  credits INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
  notification_preferences JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT 
    '{"promotions": true, "featureUpdates": true, "generalAlerts": true}'
);
-- RLS Policy: Users can only access/update their own profile.
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile." ON public.users FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile." ON public.users FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
```
**Trigger:** We will set up a Postgres function that automatically creates a new `users` entry whenever a new user signs up in `auth.users`.

#### `generations`
Stores the history of all images generated by users.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.generations (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tool_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.tools(id),
  image_url TEXT, -- URL to the image in Supabase Storage
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- RLS Policy: Users can only view their own generation history.
ALTER TABLE public.generations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own generations." ON public.generations FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### `credit_usage`
Tracks every credit spent for the "Usage Tracking" feature.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.credit_usage (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tool_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.tools(id),
  credits_used INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- RLS Policy: Users can only view their own credit usage.
ALTER TABLE public.credit_usage ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own credit usage." ON public.credit_usage FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### `notifications`
Stores notifications for users.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.notifications (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'offer', 'feature', 'general'
  title_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- i18n key for the title
  message_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- i18n key for the message
  read BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- RLS Policy: Users can only manage their own notifications.
ALTER TABLE public.notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own notifications." ON public.notifications FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### `payments`
Stores a log of all payment transactions from Paymob for auditing.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.payments (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Nullable in case user is deleted
  paymob_order_id BIGINT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  merchant_order_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Our internal reference
  amount_cents INT NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  raw_response JSONB -- Store the full Paymob callback object for auditing
);
-- RLS Policy: Users can view their own payment history.
ALTER TABLE public.payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own payments." ON public.payments FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
-- Inserts are only allowed from the backend (service_role).
```

### 4.3 Static Asset & Configuration Tables
These tables replace the hardcoded mock data in `constants.ts`. Storing this data in the database allows for dynamic updates without needing to redeploy the frontend application. The client will fetch this data on startup.

#### `tools`
Defines all available tools in the application.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.tools (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  description_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  type public.tool_type NOT NULL,
  icon_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'SparklesIcon', mapped to a component on the client
  cover_image_url TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  sort_order INT DEFAULT 0
);
-- RLS Policy: Active tools are publicly readable.
ALTER TABLE public.tools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Active tools are publicly readable" ON public.tools FOR SELECT USING (is_active = TRUE);
```
**Client-Side Mapping:** The `icon_name` column stores a string identifier. The frontend will maintain a simple mapping object (e.g., `{ SparklesIcon: <SparklesIcon /> }`) to render the corresponding React component.

#### `hairstyles`
Stores all available hairstyle options for the 'Hairstyle Changer' tool.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.hairstyles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  gender public.gender NOT NULL,
  is_pro BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  category TEXT NOT NULL
);
-- RLS Policy: Hairstyles are publicly readable.
ALTER TABLE public.hairstyles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Hairstyles are publicly readable" ON public.hairstyles FOR SELECT USING (TRUE);
```

#### `hair_colors`
Stores the palette of selectable hair colors.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.hair_colors (
  hex_code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  sort_order INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 -- For ordering in the UI
);
-- RLS Policy: Hair colors are publicly readable.
ALTER TABLE public.hair_colors ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Hair colors are publicly readable" ON public.hair_colors FOR SELECT USING (TRUE);
```

#### `skin_colors`
Stores the palette of selectable skin colors.
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.skin_colors (
  hex_code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  sort_order INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 -- For ordering in the UI
);
-- RLS Policy: Skin colors are publicly readable.
ALTER TABLE public.skin_colors ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Skin colors are publicly readable" ON public.skin_colors FOR SELECT USING (TRUE);
```

## 5. Caching Strategy (In-Database)

To enhance performance and reduce redundant, costly API calls to Gemini, we will implement a caching layer directly within our PostgreSQL database. This approach avoids the complexity and cost of external caching services like Redis.

### Implementation:

-   **Cache Table:** We will create a simple key-value table within a dedicated `cache` schema.
    ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA cache;
    CREATE TABLE cache.kv_store (
      key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      value JSONB NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
    );
    ```
-   **Cache Key Generation:** In our Edge Functions, we will generate a unique, deterministic key for each generation request. This key will be a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the `user_id`, `tool_id`, `originalImageHash`, and the specific `toolParameters`. This ensures that identical requests produce the same cache key.

-   **Edge Function Logic (Cache Integration):**
    1.  Before calling the Gemini API, the function will first query the `cache.kv_store` table for the generated key.
    2.  **Cache Hit:** If a non-expired entry is found, the function will retrieve the `value` (which could be a storage URL or JSON analysis) and return it immediately, saving a credit and reducing latency.
    3.  **Cache Miss:** If no valid entry is found, the function proceeds with the Gemini API call. Upon a successful response, it will store the result in the `cache.kv_store` table with a defined expiration time (e.g., 24 hours).

-   **Cache Invalidation & Cleanup:**
    -   The `expires_at` timestamp handles automatic invalidation.
    -   We will use the **`pg_cron`** extension (available in Supabase) to schedule a daily job that purges expired rows from `cache.kv_store` to keep the table size manageable.
    ```sql
    -- Example cron job to run daily at 3 AM UTC
    SELECT cron.schedule('cleanup-cache', '0 3 * * *', 'DELETE FROM cache.kv_store WHERE expires_at < NOW()');
    ```

## 6. File Storage (Supabase Storage)

All user images must be stored securely and privately.

### Buckets:

We will configure two primary storage buckets:

1.  **`user_uploads` (Private):** Stores the original photos uploaded by users.
2.  **`generations` (Private):** Stores the AI-generated image results.

### Security Policies:

Storage buckets will be secured with policies that mirror our database RLS rules.

-   **`user_uploads` Policies:**
    -   Users can only upload files into a folder matching their own `user_id` (e.g., `user_uploads/{user_id}/original.jpg`).
    -   Users can only read/list files from their own folder.
    -   Server-side Edge Functions will have privileged access to read these files for processing.

-   **`generations` Policies:**
    -   Files can only be created by server-side Edge Functions. The client will not have upload permissions.
    -   Users can only read files from their own `user_id` folder within this bucket.

This ensures a user can never access another user's private photos.

---

## 7. Business Logic (Supabase Edge Functions)

Edge Functions are Deno-based TypeScript functions that run on the server. This is where we will move all sensitive logic, especially interactions with the Gemini API and payment provider. This prevents exposing our API keys on the client.

### Proposed Functions:

#### `process-image`
This function will be the workhorse for all image modification tools. It replaces the client-side logic in `geminiService.ts`.

-   **Trigger:** Invoked via a secure call from the client using the Supabase JS library.
-   **Input:** `toolId`, `toolParameters`, `originalImageStoragePath`.
-   **Logic:**
    1.  Verify the user is authenticated.
    2.  Check for a valid result in the **database cache**. If found, return it.
    3.  If no cache hit, check if the user has sufficient credits.
    4.  Download the original image from `user_uploads` storage.
    5.  Call the **Gemini API** using the API key stored securely as an environment variable.
    6.  Upload the new image to the `generations` storage bucket.
    7.  **Store the result in the cache**.
    8.  **In a single database transaction:**
        -   Decrement the user's `credits`.
        -   Insert into `credit_usage`.
        -   Insert into `generations`.
    9.  Return the URL of the newly generated image.

#### `analyze-face`
A dedicated function for the facial analysis tools. Logic is identical to `process-image`, but it caches and returns JSON data instead of an image URL.

#### `paymob-webhooks`
Handles subscription and credit purchase events from **Paymob**.

-   **Trigger:** Deployed as a public webhook endpoint that Paymob's servers will call after a transaction event.
-   **Logic:**
    1.  **Verify the Webhook:** Securely verify the incoming request's `HMAC` signature using our Paymob HMAC secret. This is a critical step to ensure the request is genuinely from Paymob and not a malicious actor.
    2.  **Parse the Event:** Parse the `TRANSACTION` callback object sent by Paymob.
    3.  **Check Status:** Inspect the `obj.success` and `obj.pending` fields. A successful, completed payment will have `success: true` and `pending: false`.
    4.  **Identify the User/Order:** Use the `obj.order.merchant_order_id` to identify the user or internal transaction in our database. We will set this ID when initiating the payment from our app.
    5.  **Log the Payment:** Insert a record into the `payments` table for auditing and history, storing the full callback object.
    6.  **Fulfill the Order:** Based on the successful transaction, update the user's account in the `users` table (e.g., upgrade their `plan_id` or add credits).

---

## 8. Real-time Capabilities (Supabase Realtime)

Supabase Realtime allows us to push data to the client without requiring the client to poll for changes.

### Implementation:

-   **Notifications:**
    -   The client will subscribe to changes on the `notifications` table, filtered for their `user_id`.
    -   When a new notification is inserted, Supabase will instantly push the new row to the client.
-   **Credit Balance:**
    -   The client will subscribe to updates on its own row in the `users` table.
    -   When an Edge Function deducts a credit, the change is pushed to the client, and the UI updates automatically.
-   **Configuration Data:**
    - The client will subscribe to changes on the `tools`, `hairstyles`, etc. tables. If we remotely disable a tool or add a new hairstyle, the UI will update in real-time.

---

## 9. Deployment and Workflow

-   **Local Development:** We will use the **Supabase CLI** to run the entire Supabase stack locally in Docker.
-   **Database Migrations:** All schema changes will be managed through migration files generated by the Supabase CLI, ensuring a repeatable and version-controlled database setup.
-   **Data Seeding:** The initial static data (plans, tools, hairstyles, colors) will be added via a seed script as part of the database migration process.
-   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive keys (Gemini API key, Paymob secrets, JWT secret) will be managed as secrets in the Supabase Project Dashboard and will be securely injected into Edge Functions at runtime. They will **never** be hardcoded or exposed to the client.
